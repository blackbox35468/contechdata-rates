# AU seed library

This folder contains the AU seed data, schema, and supporting docs.
Source files live in NRM/ and the staging workspace is in workspace/au.

Expected outputs:
- docs/ (data model, rate structure, NRM mapping, pricing adjustments, AI integration)
- reference-data/ (NRM elements, units, regions, etc)
- seed-data/ (rates, resources, factors)
- supabase/ (migrations and functions)
- types/ (generated types and enums)
