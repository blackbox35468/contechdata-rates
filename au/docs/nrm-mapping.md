# NRM Mapping Guide

## Overview

This guide explains the National Resource Method (NRM) classification system used in Australian construction estimating, including the two versions (NRM1 and NRM2) and how they map to each other for composite rate calculations.

## NRM1 Hierarchy

NRM1 is structured in three levels, providing increasing levels of detail for cost breakdown:

### Level 1: Groups (14 Categories)

Groups provide the highest-level categorization of construction work:

| Code | Group Name | Purpose |

| 0 | Facilitating works | Preliminary and preparatory works, hazardous material treatment, demolition |
| 1 | Substructure | Foundations, basement works, ground floors |
| 2 | Superstructure | Structural frame, floors, roof, external walls, internal walls, doors |
| 3 | Finishes | Wall finishes, floor finishes, ceiling finishes |
| 4 | Fittings, furnishings and equipment | General fittings, kitchen equipment, special-purpose installations |
| 5 | Services | Sanitary, heating, cooling, electrical, lifts, fire protection, communications |
| 6 | Prefabricated buildings and building units | Complete buildings, building units, prefabricated components |
| 7 | Works to existing buildings | Alterations, repairs, cleaning, facade retention, conservation |
| 8 | External works | Site clearance, roads, paving, fencing, landscaping, drainage, external services |
| 9 | Main contractor preliminaries | Temporary facilities, site management, site supervision |
| 10 | Main contractor design | Design fees for contractor-led design |
| 11 | Main contractor other costs | Insurance, bonds, warranties, contingencies |
| 12 | Works by others | Work provided by third parties |

| 32 | Furniture, fittings and equipment | Fittings |
| 33 | Drainage above | Plumbing |
| 34 | Drainage below | Drainage |
| 35 | Site works | Site Works |
| 36 | Fencing | Fencing |
| 37 | Soft landscaping | Landscaping |
| 38 | Mechanical services | HVAC |
| 39 | Electrical services | Electrical |

| 41 | Builder's work in connection with mechanical, electrical and transportation installations | Structural Support |

### Level 2: Items (352 Individual Work Items)

Each Work Section contains multiple Items that describe specific work activities and their measurement units.

**Example - Work Section 11 (In-situ concrete works)**:
- WS11.1 - Mass concrete (m³)
- WS11.2 - Horizontal work (m³)
- WS11.3 - Sloping work < 150° (m³)
- WS11.5 - Vertical work (m³)
- WS11.6 - Sundry in-situ (m/m³)

**Example - Work Section 15 (Structural metalwork)**:
- WS15.1 - Framed members, framing and fabrication (t)
- WS15.3 - Isolated structural members, fabrication (t)
- WS15.4 - Isolated structural members, permanent erection on site (nr)
- WS15.5 - Allowance (t)

## NRM1 to NRM2 Mapping

The mapping between NRM1 and NRM2 is **many-to-many**, meaning:
- One NRM1 element can map to multiple NRM2 items (one-to-many)
- One NRM2 item can support multiple NRM1 elements (many-to-one)

This flexibility allows different estimation approaches while maintaining cross-referencing capability.

### Mapping Statistics

- **Total NRM1 Elements**: 50
- **Total NRM2 Work Sections**: 40
- **Total NRM2 Items**: 352
- **Documented Mappings**: 80

### Mapping Example 1: Substructure

**NRM1 Element 1.1 (Standard foundations)** maps to multiple NRM2 items across concrete, masonry, and piling:

| NRM2 Work Section | NRM2 Items | Description |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| 11 - In-situ concrete | WS11.1-WS11.44 | Foundation concrete work (mass concrete, horizontal/vertical work, reinforcement) |
| 5 - Excavating and filling | WS5.1-WS5.20 | Foundation excavation and fill |
| 14 - Masonry | WS14.1-WS14.25 | Masonry foundation walls |

**Rationale**: A standard foundation may use concrete footings and ground slabs, plus excavation and fill, with potential masonry basement walls—requiring multiple NRM2 sections.

### Mapping Example 2: Roof Coverings

**NRM1 Element 2.3.2 (Roof coverings)** maps to both sheet and tile/slate roofing sections:

| NRM2 Work Section | NRM2 Items | Description |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| 17 - Sheet roof coverings | WS17.1-WS17.9 | Membranes, flashings, gutters (m²/m) |
| 18 - Tile and slate roof coverings | WS18.1-WS18.4 | Tile/slate installation (m²) |
| 19 - Waterproofing | WS19.1-WS19.14 | Additional waterproofing systems (m²) |

**Rationale**: Different roof types (sheet membrane vs. tile) use different NRM2 sections, but both fulfill the same NRM1 element requirement.

### Mapping Example 3: Electrical Installations

**NRM1 Element 5.8 (Electrical installations)** maps to multiple electrical-related NRM2 items:

| NRM2 Work Section | NRM2 Items | Description |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| 39 - Electrical services | WS39.1-WS39.22 | Primary equipment, cables, terminals, testing |
| 41 - Builder's work | WS41.1-WS41.27 | Structural support for electrical (sleeves, bases, chases) |

**Rationale**: Electrical work requires both primary trade work (by electrician) and supporting structural work (by builder).

## How Mapping Drives Composite Rate Selection

The mapping relationship is fundamental to selecting appropriate composite rates during cost estimation.

```

### Example: Pricing Roof Coverings (2.3.2)

The system identifies that NRM1 Element 2.3.2 maps to NRM2 sections 17, 18, and 19:

| NRM2 Item | Measurement Unit | Typical Composite Description | Example Rate |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|
| WS17.1 | m² | Sheet roof membrane, all types > 500mm wide | $25-45/m² |
| WS17.5 | m | Flashings (metal, proprietary, boundary work) | $18-35/m |
| WS17.6 | m | Gutters and downpipes (all materials) | $12-25/m |
| WS18.1 | m² | Tile/slate coverings > 500mm width | $35-60/m² |
| WS18.3 | m | Tile/slate boundary work and details | $22-40/m |
| WS19.1 | m² | Waterproofing membranes (liquid, sheet, spray) | $15-35/m² |

An estimator creates a detailed scope (e.g., 250m² sheet membrane roof + 85m of flashing) and applies:
- 250m² × $30/m² = $7,500 (membrane)
- 85m × $25/m = $2,125 (flashing)
- **Total = $9,625**

## Composite Rates and the Mapping Framework

Composite rates are pre-built cost packages that combine labour, materials, and plant into a single rate. They are organized by NRM2 code to align with detailed measurement.

### Composite Rate Structure

Each composite rate includes:
- **NRM2 Code Assignment**: Which work section and item it relates to
- **Measurement Unit**: The basis for pricing (m², m, nr, etc.)
- **Labour Cost Component**: Trade-specific labour (e.g., bricklayer, carpenter)
- **Material Cost Component**: Material costs with waste factors
- **Plant Cost Component**: Equipment/plant hire (if applicable)
- **Conditions**: Context modifiers (height access, site congestion, etc.)

### Example Composite: Masonry Foundation Wall (WS14.1)

A typical composite for "Walls, overall thickness stated" under Work Section 14 (Masonry):

| Component | Detail | Rate |
|-----------|--------|------|
| **Labour** | Bricklayer + Labourer, 8-hour day crew | $85/m² |
| **Material** | Bricks, mortar, damp-proof course | $42/m² |
| **Plant** | Scaffold hire, mixing equipment | $8/m² |
| **Condition Modifiers** | High-access (>3m) +15%, Restricted site -5% | — |
| **Total Base Rate** | — | $135/m² |

When a scope specifies "100m² of 200mm cavity masonry foundation wall, high-access site":
- Qty: 100m²
- Base rate: $135/m²
- Access modifier: +15%
- **Total: 100m² × $135 × 1.15 = $15,525**

### Linking NRM1 to Composite Rates

The mapping document enables estimators to:

1. **Translate scope**: "Standard foundation walls (NRM1 1.1.1)" → "Masonry walls, all types (NRM2 14.x)"
2. **Find composites**: Search composite database by NRM2 code "14.1-14.25"
3. **Apply rates**: Select applicable composites based on specific requirements (brick type, cavity width, height, access)
4. **Build estimate**: Assemble final cost by aggregating composites across all mapped NRM2 sections

## Key Principles

1. **Many-to-Many Relationship**: NRM1 elements map to multiple NRM2 items; this flexibility enables different estimation approaches

2. **Trade-Based Organization**: NRM2 is organized by trade and activity (masonry, concrete, carpentry), while NRM1 is organized by building component (walls, floors, roof)

3. **Composite Selection**: Once an NRM1 scope item is mapped to NRM2 codes, estimators search the composite database by NRM2 code to find appropriate cost packages

4. **Complete Coverage**: The mapping ensures that every NRM1 scope item can be broken down into specific, measurable NRM2 work items with available rate data

5. **Cross-Reference Capability**: The mapping allows cost data and estimates to be reported at either NRM1 (summary) or NRM2 (detailed) level

## Usage in ContechData

ContechData's `nrm1_nrm2_mapping.json` file contains 80 documented mappings, covering:
- **Substructure**: Foundations, concrete work, excavation
- **Superstructure**: Frames, floors, roof, walls, doors, windows
- **Finishes**: Wall, floor, and ceiling finishes
- **Services**: Mechanical, electrical, plumbing, fire protection
- **External Works**: Site works, drainage, landscaping

The mapping is applied in the **composite rate matching pipeline** (`EB-match-composites` edge function), which:
1. Parses the estimated scope item (NRM1 level)
2. Identifies applicable NRM2 codes via the mapping
3. Searches the composite database by NRM2 code
4. Returns matched composites with methodology and rates

This enables rapid, accurate cost estimation aligned with industry standards.
